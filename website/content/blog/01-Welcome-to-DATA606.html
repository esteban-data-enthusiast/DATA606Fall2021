<p>Welcome to DATA606! My name is <a href="https://bryer.org">Dr.Â Jason Bryer</a> and I will be your instructor for this semester. I am an Assistant Professor and Associate Director in the Data Science and Information Systems department at CUNY SPS. Couple of important notes as you get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>The course syllabus located here: <a href="https://fall2021.data606.net/course-overview" class="uri">https://fall2021.data606.net/course-overview</a> I will post all course materials there. Blackboard will be used primarily for submitting assignments. <strong>Please read the syllabus carefully!</strong> Send me any questions you may still have about the course.</li>
<li>Complete this <a href="https://forms.gle/6V5GrsgvGWFj98hN8">Google Form</a> as soon as possible. I will use some of the data (in aggregate) in the meetup.</li>
<li><a href="">Join the Slack channel by clicking here</a>. This will be our primary mode of communication. For private communications, you can either send private Slack messages or email me at <a href="mailto:jason.bryer@sps.cuny.edu">jason.bryer@sps.cuny.edu</a>.</li>
<li>Once you go through the syllabus, try starting Lab 1 as soon as you can. This will require you to install R and RStudio and will help get you get acquainted with R. See the <a href="/course-overview/software/">software page</a> for more information about the software we will use for this course.</li>
<li>The best way to reach me is by Slack or email at <a href="mailto:jason.bryer@sps.cuny.edu">jason.bryer@sps.cuny.edu</a>. If you would prefer to talk on the phone or setup a Zoom session, it is best to suggest some times by email first.</li>
<li>Our Meetups will be on Wednesdays from 8:30pm to 9:30pm. <strong>I expect everyone to attend or watch the Meetups.</strong> Important information will be shared during the meetups that will not be available in any other format.</li>
<li>I am looking forward to getting to know everyone and a fantastic semester! Good luck!</li>
</ul>
