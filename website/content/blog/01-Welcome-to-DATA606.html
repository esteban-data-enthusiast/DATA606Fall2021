<p>Welcome to DATA606! Your instructors will be <a href="https://bryer.org">Dr. Jason Bryer</a> and Dr. Angela Lui. Couple of important notes as you get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>The course syllabus located here: <a href="https://fall2021.data606.net/course-overview" class="uri">https://fall2021.data606.net/course-overview</a>. We will post all course materials there. Blackboard will be used primarily for submitting assignments. <strong>Please read the syllabus carefully!</strong> Send us any questions you may still have about the course.</li>
<li>Complete this <a href="https://forms.gle/6V5GrsgvGWFj98hN8">Google Form</a> as soon as possible. We will use some of the data (in aggregate) in the meetup.</li>
<li><a href="https://join.slack.com/t/data606fall2021/shared_invite/zt-tqeu5u6e-qIimBoChX2oyvCJLovewWg">Join the Slack channel by clicking here</a>. This will be our primary mode of communication.

<li>Once you go through the syllabus, try starting Lab 1 as soon as you can. This will require you to install R and RStudio and will help get you get acquainted with R.
